\section{\uppercase{Introduction}}
\label{sec:introduction}
\noindent Your paper will be part of the conference proceedings
therefore we ask that authors follow the guidelines explained in
this example in order to achieve the highest quality possible
\cite{Smith98}.

Be advised that papers in a technically unsuitable form will be
returned for retyping. After returned the manuscript must be
appropriately modified.

\section{\uppercase{Manuscript Preparation}}
\noindent We strongly encourage authors to use this document for the
preparation of the camera-ready. Please follow the instructions
closely in order to make the volume look as uniform as possible
\cite{Moore99}.

Please remember that all the papers must be in English and without
orthographic errors.

Do not add any text to the headers (do not set running heads) and
footers, not even page numbers, because text will be added
electronically.

For a best viewing experience the used font should be Times New
Roman, except on special occasions, such as program code
\ref{subsubsec:program_code}.


\subsection{Manuscript Setup}
\noindent The template is composed by a set of 12 files, in the
following 3 groups:

\noindent {\bf Group 1.} To format your paper you will need to copy
into your working directory, but NOT edit, the following 5 files:
\begin{verbatim}
  - apalike.bst
  - apalike.sty
  - article.cls
  - fancyhdr.sty
  - scitepress.sty
\end{verbatim}

\noindent {\bf Group 2.} You also need to copy into your working
directory and edit the following 4 template files:
\begin{verbatim}
  - abstract.tex
  - authors.tex
  - keywords.tex
  - title.tex
\end{verbatim}

These files are structured and already have an example of the kind
of information you should insert at the proper
places.\vspace*{0.2cm}

\noindent {\bf Group 3.} Additionally, you may wish to copy and edit
the following 3 example files:
\begin{verbatim}
  - example.bib
  - example.tex
  - insticc.eps
\end{verbatim}
