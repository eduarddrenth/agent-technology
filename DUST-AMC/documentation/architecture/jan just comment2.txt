if you submit an agent-job to the grid, which in turn starts something
else then the grid "sees" only the agent-job. The agent-job will run for
as long as your job-slot is, even if the actual 'grib-job shell' as you
call it has terminated. Be aware that the VO is also "charged" for
however long the agent-job will run , even if the agent is doing nothing
at all

So it is not problematic to keep the agent alive after the payload job
finishes , except for the fact that you're consuming resources (and
eating up allocated fair share) which might be used more efficiently.
