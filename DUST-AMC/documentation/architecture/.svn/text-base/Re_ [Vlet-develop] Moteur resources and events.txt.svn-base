Hi,

Thanks for your response. In the attachment is a version of the amc project. You

* The goal is to have two agents started for each workflow, one at VBrowser, one at MOTEUR. In case of jobfailure one agent starts on a workernode. The agent
system should as independent as possible.

* Extending the MOTEUR plugin sounds like tight coupling, a notifying approach is more loosely coupled, I am in favor of this approach. The only thing the
MOTEUR plugin has to do is fire an event that can be recognized as a 'start MOTEUR workflow event' together with the workflow id. In fact I realy don't care
much about the recognition mechanism, but to look upon 'start MOTEUR workflow event' as a NEW_RESOURCE event in terms of VRL sounds logical to me at first
glance.

* Perhaps the simplest way is to fire a ResourceEvent from the MOTEUR plugin that holds the URL (https://....) to the workflow information and is recognizable
as a 'workflow start' through a special String in the message.

* Monitoring on the server side would imply an extra process running on the server. And if we delegate the initiative for starting agents on the MOTEUR server
we have a harder time finding our way back to the VBrowser instance.

* I totaly agree with you that URI analysis is not the way to go

* I do not know about the WS resource, is that an alternative to introducing a MOTEUR resource?

* When a 'MOTEUR workflow' receives the predicate resource, this blurs the definition of 'resource'. 1 it is temporary and 2 basically it is just a http(s)
resource (and/or WS resource)

Recap:

1 I favor a notification approach above a extending approach
2 I would not introduce an extra monitoring process on the MOTEUR server
3 There are good reasons not to introduce a MOTEUR vrl
4 For the time being I base my development on 'ResourceEvent with special message'
