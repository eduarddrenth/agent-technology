hi Eduard,

sorry that i could not talk much.
im stuck in Stockholm because of the volcano
dont know when i can get back to nl

we should schedule a skype meeting to talk details about the next steps.

the most important is to have a plan
perhaps start sketching the story we want to tell and think what type of data we need to collect for the evaluation. could you please start it?

workplace at the AMC is very difficult now.
that room now has 5 people, 4 working full time.
we need to think carefully about the need for your presence in amsterdam
anyways, it would not make sense before i am there, right?

could you please get hold remotely on the status and the needs and organize the paper in the meantime?

thanks a lot for your understanding, groet,
